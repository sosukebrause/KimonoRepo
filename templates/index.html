        <h3>Summer Yukata</h3>
        <p>
          A yukata is a type of Japanese kimono, but more casual than the more
          famous silk version. Made of lightweight, breathable
          materials–typically cotton–yukata are perfect for summer. A yukata is
          easy to put on and can be worn on bare skin. Thickness may vary to
          suit each season

        <h3>Men's Jinbei</h3>
        <p>
          A "jinbei" (甚平) is a traditional Japanese summer garment, often worn
          as loungewear or pajamas. It consists of a loose-fitting, kimono-style
          top and matching shorts or pants. Jinbei are typically made from
          light, breathable fabrics like linen or cotton, and are usually
          aerated around the shoulders making them comfortable for warm weather.

        <h3>Traditional Happi</h3>
        <p>
          A "Happi" coat (法被) is a traditional Japanese jacket, often worn at
          festivals or as a uniform by tradespeople or firefighters. It's
          typically made of cotton and features a loose, often long (kneelength
          or longer), design. Happi coats can be recognized by their bold
          patterns, vibrant colors, and the presence of a back crest or collar
          crest indicating the wearer's affiliation or brand

        <h3>Haori</h3>
        <p>
          A haori (羽織) is a traditional Japanese jacket-garment worn over a
          kimono. It's a type of outer garment, resembling a shortened kimono
          with no overlapping front panels. Haoris can be formal or casual, and
          they often feature a thinner collar and large sleeve pockets
